# CS_175 Midori Hat Search System
UCI CS 175 Machine Learning Project in MineCraft


- In this project, we designed an agent that can search for given objects in an open map, and craft objects based on recipe after retrieving those materials. 
- The agent will firstly avoid lava. However, after exploring the whole map, if the agent has not found everything it is asked to, 
  it will use water to pave a path through lava to keep looking. 
- The agent will dump things that it does not need once in a while. 
- The agent search the map via depth-frist.
